            And then Simcha appeared, Simcha Nierenberg, the legend himself! I don't recall much, but I can tell you that the fight was very brief. Those guys didn't stand a chance. Flash forward five years into the future (currently the present), and once again I stand at an emotional dilemma. Although not as scary as the alleyway,
            this matter is much more pressing. I need to provide for a family now, pay the bills, etc. Society is just as unforgiving as those goons - although it does it with a friendly smile and the misconception that money is free and lasts forever. But once again Simcha appeared and offered to help me out. "I have a solution to your problems", he said, 
            although this time there would be a price. I would have to sell my body and soul - become a "meme" as they call it nowadays. Was I ready to face the world? I was desperate for the support.
            But the real question was, is the world ready to face me? I'll let you ponder that as you warm yourself in a your new sweater or whatever else you decide to buy.`,

        "text":`Hi, I'm Simcha Nierenburg, CEO and Founder of STAP Inc. As most stories go (think all AGT backstories - 100% drama, 0% truth), this company was a dream of mine from a very young age. I remember when I was five (or was it four) years old, and I was alone in the house - mom was out shopping or something.
            Anyway, being a mischievous five year old, and having the whole house to myself, I decided to do some "exploring". "Don't play with the markers when I'm not home" my mom used to say. Well, now I was going to find out just how fun it was to play with markers when "mom wasn't home". I pulled up a chair, got a piece of paper, and some markers, and got to work. 
            "Drawing is so enjoyable, why is this not allowed" I thought. As you can probably guess, I ended up making a huge mess and when mom got back, she made me clean it all up. Why am I telling you all of this? Because as we were cleaning up, one of my doodles dropped to the floor. And there it was - my masterpiece! In that moment I knew I had found my calling, my life mission. 
            Forget lawyers, doctors, or all the other high-paying jobs that are only paying you back the money you spent on school - I was going into MERCH business! 'Hey, it's maz, I'm a workoholic and I have writers block at 2 AM'`,
